#    variable and its types
# variable naming- must start with a letter or an underscore(_)
#                 must consists of letter , numbers and underscore only
#                 case sensisitive not like HTML


#  no need to define the variable in python

#  example:

# it understands by the indentation that is by spaces

# z= 5000000000000000000
# y= 5.5
# x= 5
# print(x,y,z)

# no need int x=5


# assignment statements:-
# remember about the indentation

# x= 5 * 5 * (1-1)
# print(x)

#    TYPE FUNCTION()
# it tells about the memory location that is what type its belongs to- string(str), integer(int), decimal(double,float)

# x= "Hello class :)"
# y= 5.5
# z= type(x)
# a= type(y)
# print(z, a)
